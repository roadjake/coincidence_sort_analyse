WHAT DO THE DIFFERENT SCRIPT CONTAIN?

'Ana.cc'-> includes 'Ana.hh' and 'AnaRoot.hh'
        -> initializes some of the parameters; 
        -> reads the calibration file and the histo file; 
        -> decides whether to create different coinc-trees;
        -> creates the root file from the bin file; 
        -> sorts the data into the different histograms, trees and matrices defined; 
        -> makes coincidences if required.

'Ana.hh'-> includes 'AnaDefs.hh' and 'AnaRoot.hh'
        -> creates public classes for different trees;
        -> defines a series of variables and arrays;
        -> defines an array of 1D histograms, different 2D histograms, and several other 1D histo.

'AnaDefs.hh'-> defines all different parametes that need to be set to sort the data (like the energy and time threshold);
            -> defines different structures that will be used to sort the data in 'Ana.cc'
            -> here we can set different values for some of the parameters, in order to sort the data according to our needs.

'AnaDict.cc'-> includes 'AnaRoot.hh'
            -> I think it defines the classes for the storage of data from Si detectors and Ge detectors
            -> yes, I am not really sure about this, and there's also written that it shouldn't be changed, so I don't know.

'AnaMain.cc'-> includes 'Ana.hh'
            -> reads the bin file and starts the sorting.

'AnaRoot.hh'-> includes 'AnaDefs.hh'
            -> defines the classes for the storage of data, and all the arrays and variables inside them. 

'calib.cfg'-> says that the calibration file is calib.dat

'calib.dat'-> contains the calibration parameters for the different detectors (values should be changed only on the first row of each block.

'config.cfg'-> contains parameters that set some functions on or off (like si-si coincidence)

'hist.cfg'-> contains all the histograms used to sort the data (name, number of bins, minimum bin value, maximum bin value)

'run'-> contains the commands to start the sorting of the data

'sortData'-> contains the info to run each bin file singularly (where the bin file is stored, where the root file will be created...)
